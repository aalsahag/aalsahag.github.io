I am a lecturer and researcher at the University of Amsterdam, specializing in data science and artificial intelligence. My work focuses on developing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technology and real-world applications.I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science and have an international academic background, having pursued studies and research opportunities across different countries. This diverse experience has equipped me with a broad perspective and a deep understanding of global technological challenges and solutions.

Research Background & Interests:
Energy Consumption Forecasting: Developing advanced machine learning models to predict energy demand patterns, with a focus on enhancing the accuracy and lead time of forecasts. My latest publication, "Enhancing the Predictability of Wintertime Energy Demand in The Netherlands Using Ensemble Model Prophet-LSTM," addresses the challenges of energy demand forecasting in the context of rising energy prices and climate change impacts.
AI-Based Environmental Monitoring: Leading projects such as "AI-Based Monitoring and Quality Prediction of Groundwater in Zuid-Holland," aiming to integrate artificial intelligence techniques for environmental sustainability.
Transportation Analytics: Investigating the application of machine learning in transportation systems, exemplified by the project "Forecasting the Evolution of Delays and Its Influencers in the Dutch Train Network Using Machine Learning," which seeks to improve the efficiency and reliability of train services in the Netherlands.
